            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I’m Aries with Scorpio rising, born and raised in Recife/Brazil. If you know what that means, don’t panic, that’s not as bad as you think. If you don’t know, well, it’s probably better this way, sometimes this stereotype doesn’t fit well.
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I have an older sister and I studied my whole life at the same school, where I made friends who grew up by my side and are always there. I was also an athlete, I played volleyball, and I learned a lot with that. Sports taught me teamwork, how to control nervousness and anxiety, to overcome defeats and, above all things, that no victory is good enough if not shared. Winning alone is no fun, it’s the people who are with you that make the journey and the conquer worthwhile.

            <h4>Living abroad</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              In 2009, I lived for two months in Montreal, Canada. My intention when I left Brazil was to study English, but this trip ended up being much more than that. There, I met very especial people that have been with me since then, besides that, I had the pleasure of meeting people from all over the world. 
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I consider Montreal the most miscegenated city I’ve ever been to. The experience of living there and feeling all that mixing of cultures everyday opened my eyes to how different the world and the people on that are and how much we can learn from all the different culture spreaded around. There, I also had the pleasure of having an incredible family, and I keep with affection all the memories of the moments I had with my host parents, my three brothers and the other exchange student that lived with us back then. They were essential to make this trip work and be so special.

           <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The greatest pleasure I have in life can be summed up in a single verb: “to travel”. Traveling is my greatest passion, visiting new places, seeing stunning views and meeting very different people and cultures, nothing gets me more excited or gives me more satisfaction than that. For me, as Mário Quintana would say, traveling is changing the soul’s clothes!           
           </p>
           <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Among my other passions are soccer, TV shows, chocolate, family and friends. Those are the things I use to spend most part of my free time. About my dreams, well, it couldn’t be different, the biggest one is traveling around all the world. I also badly want to have the opportunity to live abroad for a while and to go to a Soccer World Cup and an Olympics.

          <h4>Professional</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I’m graduated in Business Administration and did an extension course in Tax Planning. In Administration, I worked with the supply area, with commercial planning and with digital media. Despite that, what I love in business is related to accounting, finance, investments, taxes and areas connected to that.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            However, I was always a heavy user of technologies and I always wanted to get to know the world behind it better. So, in 2020, I decided to change my professional area and to seek for new challenges connected with another passion of mine: technology.  I found out that this is what I want to work with and decided starting a new course in Internet Systems Programming at Universidade Católica de Pernambuco (UNICAP). I’m still in the first semester and don’t have a lot of technical knowledge, but I’ve already got in love even more with the area and have already managed to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS. At this moment, I’m seeking for an opportunity in the job market to put in practice my initial knowledge and to add much more to my learning process.

            If you’ve got here, this webpage was the way I found to show you a little bit of what I’ve already started learning. I hope you have enjoyed, if you would like to offer me an opportunity to work, the links to my social networks are on the page's footer, or you can also click on my image on the top of the page to be redirected to my Linkedin web page.
